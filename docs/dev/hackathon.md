### Overview

- Hackathon starts 12:00 EDT, July 1st.
- Submissions close at 18:00 EDT, July 7th.
- Over $10,000 in rewards, distributed based on a JokeDAO token vote.
- Collaboration between [Juicebox DAO](https://juicebox.money), [Buidl Guidl](https://buidlguidl.com/), and [JokeDAO](http://jokedao.io/).

### Criteria

Make an interesting project! Criteria is subjective and up to token recipients.

Our wish list:
- A scaffold-eth starter kit for buidling a Juicebox project frontend.
- A Juicebox protocol [extension](learn/architecture.md) starter kit.
- A scaffold-eth NFT branch that sends funds to a Juicebox treasury. *See [tiles.art](https://tiles.art)* 
- An all-in-one [multisig.lol](https://multisig.lol) + Juicebox interface, with full read/write.
- A buidl-guidl-centric dapp for managing the group's Juicebox treasury.
- A [nifty.ink](https://nifty.ink/) fork which sends funds to a Juicebox treasury.

### Rules

All projects must use [scaffold-eth](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth), [Juicebox v2](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-contracts-v2), and an [open source license](https://opensource.org/licenses).
