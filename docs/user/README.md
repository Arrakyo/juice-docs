# Intro

#### *Juicebox helps people confidently run programmable and community funded treasuries from startup to scale, openly on Ethereum.*

![](/img/characters.png)

The Juicebox protocol is a framework for funding and operating projects openly on Ethereum. Its contracts allow communities to receive funds, issue tokens for community membership, and configure funding cycles to transparently utilize those fundsâ€”all in powerful, customizable ways. 

Juicebox treasuries can evolve over time, allowing people to launch open-ended projects and to adjust constraints, extensions, and incentives over time as needed. The protocol is light enough for a group of friends, yet powerful enough for a global network of anons sharing thousands of ETH, ERC-20s, or other assets.

**If you are interested in building a project on Juicebox**, visit [juicebox.money](https://juicebox.money). To learn how you can configure your project, read the [Project Creation Guide](/user/project). If you have questions, join the [Juicebox Discord](https://discord.gg/juicebox).

We have [Discord Town Halls](https://discord.gg) every Tuesday at 22:00 UTC. Stop by and say hello!

*The Juicebox protocol is built and maintained by [Juicebox DAO](/dao/).*
