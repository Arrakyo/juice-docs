# Make a Discord Server

Discord is among the most popular social platform in crypto. It allows users to create free, invite-only servers for their communities. Discord servers support messaging across multiple channels, voice/video calls, and the configuration of complex permission structures. Discord also supports bots and other automations through its API.

## Get Discord

If you don't already have an account, create one at [discord.gg](https://discord.gg). You can access Discord via a web browser or through its native apps on Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, or Linux. If you are a complete beginner, take a look at Discord's [beginner's guide](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045138571-Beginner-s-Guide-to-Discord).
