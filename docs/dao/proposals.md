3. Once your proposal is ready, change its status from `Draft` to `Discussion`.
4. A discussion thread for your proposal will be generated in the `#ðŸ’¡-proposals` channel of [Juicebox's Discord server](https://discord.gg/juicebox). The community will help you prepare the proposal for the next [temperature check](../process).

*The revision process can cause a proposal to take more than one funding cycle to reach the Juicebox snapshot. Honest and plain feedback in Discord proposal threads is encouraged.*
