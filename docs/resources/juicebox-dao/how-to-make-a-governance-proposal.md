# How to Make a Governance Proposal

*Note: Juicebox DAO operates on a 14 day governance cycle which you can read about [here](governance-process.md). You can see where we are in the current cycle on the [Governance Cycle Calendar](https://www.notion.so/09936865803248e38c82adbc3ed32137).*

*The revision process will often cause a proposal to take more than one funding cycle to reach the Juicebox snapshot. Honest and plain feedback in Discord proposal threads is encouraged.*

**In order to create a new proposal:**

1. Head to the [proposals database](https://www.notion.so/9d126f9148dc42ee83317d5cd74e4db4).
2. Click the â¬‡ next to "New" (pictured below) and select `ðŸ“œ Proposal Template`

3. Fill out the template by following the [Proposal Template](proposal-template.md). Once you've answered each question in the template to the best of your ability, change your proposalâ€™s *status* (the first Notion field at the top of the document) from `Draft` to `Discussion`.
4. A discussion thread for your proposal will be automatically generated in #ðŸ’¡-proposals-workshop on the [Juicebox Discord](https://discord.gg/juicebox). From there, community members will help you to prepare the proposal for the next temperature check.
