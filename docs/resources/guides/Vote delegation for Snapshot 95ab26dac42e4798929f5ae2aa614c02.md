# Vote delegation for Snapshot

As projects in Juicebox pay the 2.5% fees every time they distribute payouts, they all get that same amount back in JBX. This gives project owner the power to vote in Snapshot.

Many project owner wallets are multi-sig wallets, managed trough Gnosis.

Gnosis doesn’t let you vote in snapshot, because it doesn’t support the signing mechanism needed.

So, for voting with a multi-sig wallet, you need to delegate your votes to someone who actually uses a simpler wallet.

To do so, you can follow the steps in the Snapshot delegation guide: [https://docs.snapshot.org/guides/delegation](https://docs.snapshot.org/guides/delegation) - which is quoted below:

## Delegate voting power from Snapshot interface

1. Go to [https://snapshot.page/#/delegate](https://snapshot.page/#/delegate).
2. Type in which address you want to delegate to.
3. Type in the space key you want your delegation to take effect on. *(If no space is selected, the effect will take place for all spaces)*
4. Click confirm to save your delegation
